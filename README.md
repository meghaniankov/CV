A junior developer with a passion for solving puzzles, building things, and using data to tell a story. 

My goal is to build a career in software development, where I can be challenged daily to solve problems and build exciting things.

## Background
Before starting [Makers](https://makers.tech/), I worked for 8+ years in Corporate Finance, using VBA to build Excel macros every chance I could. I left finance to start an e-commerce business, where I did basic front-end design for my website. Eventually I started [experimenting with A.I.](https://shopaffiance.com/pages/affiance-intelligence) to create a tool from my business and that's when the programming bug really bit me!

## Skills

#### Creatively Analytical  

I am a highly analytical person. I get really excited about spreadsheets and data sets. I love using numbers and data to help tell a story that everyone can understand.

###

#### Problem Solving
I love using technology to solve problems. I taught myself VBA in order to build Excel tools to automate repetive tasks for my team. I wanted a tool to analyze wedding dress pictures and return personalized bridal accessories. Nothing like that existed, so I built one.
###

#### Entrepreneurial  

I have started two businesses in the past two years. The first was a company that held virtual reality events at bars around New York City. The second, and most recent, was an e-commerce store focusing on wedding accessories. In both cases, although I knew nothing about the industries, I saw a market need and learned all of the skills I needed along the way.

###

#### Teamwork & Communication  

I love working cross-functionally. Understanding how each part of the business operations and their unique needs and challenges is the key using your role to most effectively help the company achieve it's goals.
