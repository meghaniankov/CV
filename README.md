## MEGHAN IANKOV

A junior developer with a passion for solving puzzles, building things, and using data to tell a story. During my 8+ years in corporate finance and experience with starting an e-commerce business, I have fallen in love with coding and programming. It started with VBA to build Excel macros, then HTML, CSS, and Liquid for my company's website, and then finally experimenting  with A.I. to create a tool for my business. Along the way I have been building the foundation for a career in tech. 

My goal now is to build a career in software development, where I can be challenged daily to solve problems and build exciting things.

## Skills

#### Creatively Analytical  

I am a highly analytical person. I get really excited about spreadsheets and data sets. However, I know most people aren't like that. During my career in corporate finance, I learned to use numbers and data to help tell a story that everyone could understand. I used raw data to extract insights and built dashboards and other models to create visual representations of those insights.

###

#### Problem Solving
- Taught myself VBA in order to build Excel tools to reduce manual data manipulation and increase time available for analysis.
- I wanted a tool to analyze wedding dress pictures and return personalized bridal accessories. Nothing like that existed, so I built one using A.I.
- Managed agency process re-engineering: evaluating current operations, identifying issues and roadblocks, and creating plans for optimize and automate various processes, specificially around their technologies and systems.

###

#### Entrepreneurial  

I have started two businesses in the past two years. he first was a company that held virtual reality events at bars and restaurants around New York City. The second, and most recent, was an e-commerce store focusing on wedding accessories. In both cases, although I knew nothing about the industries, I saw a market need and learned all of the skills I needed along the way.

###

#### Teamwork & Communication  

I love working cross-functionally. Understanding how each part of the business operations and their unique needs and challenges is the key using your role to most effectively help the company achieve it's goals.  
- At Raytheon, I continually supported a team that included Engineering, Sales, Contracts, HR, Supply Chain, and Finance, on a range of business development proposals  
- At Omnicom, I oversaw a portfolio of 154 global agencies and was responsible for managing the needs of both teams at the individual agencies and of corporate.
